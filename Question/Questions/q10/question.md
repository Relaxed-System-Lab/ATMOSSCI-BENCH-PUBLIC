1.7. A locomotive of $2 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~kg}$ mass travels $50 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ along a straight horizontal track at $43^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$. What lateral force is exerted on the rails? Compare the magnitudes of the upward reaction force exerted by the rails for cases where the locomotive is traveling eastward and westward, respectively.

Solution: The lateral force on the rails is just the reaction to the deflection force due to the Coriolis effect. Thus, for a locomotive of mass $M$,

$$
F=-f M u=-\left(10^{-4} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)\left(2 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~kg}\right)\left(50 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)=-10^{3} \mathrm{~N}
$$

(directed southward for a train moving eastward in the Northern Hemisphere). The upward reaction force is just the weight minus the vertical component of the Coriolis force (1.18). Thus, $F_{\text {upward }}=M(g-2 \Omega \cos \phi u)$, and the force difference between westward and eastward travel is

$$
\delta F=F_{\text {westward }}-F_{\text {eastward }}=4 \Omega \cos \phi|u| M=2 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~N}
$$
