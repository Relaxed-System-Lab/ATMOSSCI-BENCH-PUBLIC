1.10. A block of mass $M=1 \mathrm{~kg}$ is suspended from the end of a weightless string. The other end of the string is passed through a small hole in a horizontal platform and a ball of mass $m=10 \mathrm{~kg}$ is attached. At what angular velocity must the ball rotate on the horizontal platform to balance the weight of the block if the horizontal distance of the ball from the hole is 1 m ? While the ball is rotating, the block is pulled down 10 cm . What is the new angular velocity of the ball? How much work is done in pulling down the block?

Solution: Force balance for equilibrium (see Figure 1.10) is $M g=m \omega_{e}^{2} a_{e}$, where $\omega_{e}$ is the angular velocity of the ball and $a_{e}=1 \mathrm{~m}$. Solving for $\omega_{e}$ yields

$$
\omega_{e}=\left(M g / m a_{e}\right)^{1 / 2} \approx 1 \mathrm{~s} .
$$

If the block is pulled down 10 cm , then the distance of the ball from the hole is 0.9 m . By conservation of angular momentum, $\omega_{f} a_{f}^{2}=\omega_{e} a_{e}^{2}$, where subscript $f$ denotes the final state. The final angular velocity then is

$$
\omega_{f}=\omega_{e}\left(a_{e}^{2} / a_{f}^{2}\right)=1.222 \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
$$

The total work done is given by the sum of the changes in kinetic and potential energy: $\delta W=\delta K+\delta P$. Now

$$
\delta K=(m / 2)\left[\left(\omega_{f} a_{f}\right)^{2}-\left(\omega_{e} a_{e}\right)^{2}\right]=1.15 \mathrm{~J} ; \delta P=M g \delta h,
$$

where $\delta h=-10 \mathrm{~cm}$ height change. Thus, $\delta P=-0.98 \mathrm{~J}$ and $\delta W=1.15-0.98=0.17 \mathrm{~J}$.
