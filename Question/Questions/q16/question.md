3.3. A tornado rotates with constant angular velocity $\omega$. Show that the surface pressure at the center of the tornado is given by $p=p_{0} \exp \left(\frac{-\omega^{2} r_{0}^{2}}{2 R T}\right)$, where $p_{0}$ is the surface pressure at a distance $r_{0}$ from the center and $T$ is the temperature (assumed constant). If the temperature is 288 K , and pressure and wind speed at 100 m from the center are 1000 hPa and $100 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, respectively, what is the central pressure?
Solution: Letting $r$ be the distance from the axis of rotation of the tornado, and shifting to height coordinates, the cyclostrophic balance (3.14) can be expressed as $\frac{v^{2}}{r}=\frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial p}{\partial r}$. But $v=\omega r$ and $\rho^{-1}=R T / p$, so that $\frac{\partial \ln p}{\partial r}=\frac{\omega^{2} r}{R T}$. Integrating with respect to $r$ : $\int_{p_{0}}^{p} d \ln p=\left(\frac{\omega^{2}}{R T}\right) \int_{r_{0}}^{0} r d r$, or $p=p_{0} \exp \left[-\frac{\omega^{2} r_{0}^{2}}{2 R T}\right]$. Since $\frac{\omega^{2} r_{0}^{2}}{2 R T} \ll 1$, the central pressure is given by $p \approx p_{0}\left(1-\frac{\omega^{2} r_{0}^{2}}{2 R T}\right)=940 \mathrm{hPa}$.
