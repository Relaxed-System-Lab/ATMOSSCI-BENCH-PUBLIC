Question 2: A watershed is $80 \%$ good condition open space/lawn, $40 \%$ of which is soil group C and $60 \%$ is soil group A. The remaining $20 \%$ of the watershed is fairly covered forest land with soil group C. The curve numbers for different soil condition are tabulated below. Use the SCS Method to estimate the excessive precipitation for a total of 7 inches of rainfall in this watershed. State clearly all your assumptions. With normal antecedent runoff conditions (ARC II) and $\mathrm{la}=0.2 \mathrm{~S}$.

| Land use | Soil group | CN |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Good condition open space/lawn | C | 74 |
| Good condition open space/lawn | A | 39 |
| Forest land with fair cover | C | 73 |

## Suggested answers:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Weighted } \mathrm{CN}=23.68+18.72+14.6=57 \\
& \mathrm{~S}=\frac{1000}{C N}-10=\frac{1000}{57}-10=7.54 \mathrm{in} \\
& P_{e}=\frac{(P-0.2 S)^{2}}{P+0.8 S}=\frac{(7-0.2 \times 7.54)^{2}}{7+0.8 \times 7.54}=2.31 \mathrm{in}
\end{aligned}
