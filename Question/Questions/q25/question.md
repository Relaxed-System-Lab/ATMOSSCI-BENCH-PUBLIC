1. At present the emission temperature of the Earth is 255 K , and its albedo is $30 \%$. How would the emission temperature change if
(a) the albedo were reduced to $10 \%$ (and all else were held fixed);
(b) the infra-red opacity of the atmosphere were doubled, but albedo remains fixed at $30 \%$.

The emission temperature is defined as

$$
\begin{equation*}
T_{e}=\left[\frac{\left(1-\alpha_{p}\right) S}{4 \sigma}\right]^{\frac{1}{4}} \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\alpha_{p}$ is the planetary albedo, $S$ the solar flux, and $\sigma$ the StefanBoltzmann constant.

ANSWER:
(a) If albedo were reduced from $\alpha_{p}=30 \%$ to $\alpha_{p}^{\prime}=10 \%$, the emission temperature would change from $T_{e}$ (at present) to $T_{e}^{\prime}$, where

$$
\frac{T_{e}^{\prime}}{T_{e}}=\left[\frac{1-\alpha_{p}^{\prime}}{1-\alpha_{p}}\right]^{\frac{1}{4}}=\left[\frac{0.9}{0.7}\right]^{\frac{1}{4}}=1.0648
$$

so the new emission temperature would be $255 \times 1.0648=271.5 \mathrm{~K}$.
(b) Emission temperature - the temperature at which the Earth emits to space - would not change at all if atmospheric IR opacity were doubled but albedo remained fixed. Emission temperature - unlike surface temperature - depends only on how much of the solar energy flux is absorbed by the Earth and, by (1), depends only on $\alpha_{p}, S$, and $\sigma$.
