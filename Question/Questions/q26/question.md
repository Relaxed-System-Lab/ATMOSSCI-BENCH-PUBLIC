2. Suppose that the Earth is, after all, flat. Specifically, consider it to be a thin circular disk (of radius 6370 km ), orbiting the Sun at the same distance as the Earth; the planetary albedo is 30\%. The vector normal to one face of this disk always points directly toward the Sun, and the disk is made of perfectly conducting material, so both faces of the disk
are at the same temperature. Calculate the emission temperature of this disk, and compare with the result we obtained for a spherical Earth.

ANSWER:
Incoming solar flux $S_{0}=1367 \mathrm{Wm}^{-2}$; planetary albedo $\alpha_{p}=0.3$. Area of disk intercepting solar flux $=\pi a^{2}$. So,

$$
\text { Net solar input }=S_{0} \pi a^{2}\left(1-\alpha_{p}\right)
$$

Disk has temperature on both faces, so area emitting thermal radiation is $2 \pi a^{2}$. Disk emits $\sigma T_{e}^{4}$ per unit area, so

$$
\text { Net thermal emission }=2 \pi a^{2} \sigma T_{e}^{4}
$$

Balancing input and emission,

$$
\left(1-\alpha_{p}\right) S_{0} \pi a^{2}=2 \pi a^{2} \sigma T_{e}^{4}
$$

i.e.,

$$
T_{e}=\left[\frac{\left(1-\alpha_{p}\right) S_{0}}{2 \sigma}\right]^{\frac{1}{4}}=303.1 \mathrm{~K}
$$

The expression for $T_{e}$ is a factor $2^{\frac{1}{4}}$ larger than we found for a spherical Earth - the disk has the same cross-section as the sphere (and so intercepts the same amount of solar radiation) but one-half of the surface area, so must increase $T_{e}^{4}$ by a factor of 2 to compensate.
