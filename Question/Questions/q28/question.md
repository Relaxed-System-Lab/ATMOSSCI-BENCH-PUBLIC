6. Determine the emission temperature of the planet Venus. You may assume the following: the mean radius of Venus' orbit is 0.72 times that of the Earth's orbit. Given the solar flux decreases like the square of the distance from the sun and given that the planetary albedo of Venus $=0.77$, determine the emission temperature of Venus.

ANSWER:
According to the inverse square law,

$$
\frac{\text { solar flux at Venus }}{\text { solar flux at Earth }}=\left(\frac{\text { radius of Venus orbit }}{\text { radius of Earth orbit }}\right)^{-2}
$$

whence

$$
\text { solar flux at Venus }=S_{V}=\frac{1367}{0.72^{2}}=2637 \mathrm{Wm}^{-2}
$$

Therefore, in equilibrium, the emission temperature of Venus is

$$
T_{V}=\left[\frac{S_{V}\left(1-\alpha_{V}\right)}{4 \sigma}\right]^{\frac{1}{4}}
$$

where $\alpha_{V}=0.77$ is the planetary albedo of Venus and $\sigma$ the StefanBoltzmann constant. Therefore

$$
T_{V}=\left[\frac{2637 \times 0.23}{4 \times 5.67 \times 10^{-8}}\right]^{\frac{1}{4}}=227 \mathrm{~K}
$$
