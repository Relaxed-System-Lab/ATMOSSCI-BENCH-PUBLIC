Question 3: The same watershed as in Question 2, the following table summarizes the rainfall intensity during the storm event. Calculate the excessive precipitation for each time step (10 min interval).

| Time | Rainfall Intensity (in/hr) |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0-10min | 2 |
| 10-20min | 4.5 |
| 20-30min | 5 |
| $30-40 \mathrm{~min}$ | 9 |
| 40-50min | 8 |
| $50-60 \mathrm{~min}$ | 7 |
| $60-70 \mathrm{~min}$ | 3.5 |
| $70-80 \mathrm{~min}$ | 3 |

Suggested answers:
From Question 2,

- $\mathrm{S}=\frac{1000}{C N}-10=\frac{1000}{57}-10=7.54$ in
- Initial loss $I_{a}=0.2 S=1.508$ in

And for CN model,

- P-0.2S=0 when P<0.2S
- $P_{e}=\frac{\left(P-I_{a}\right)^{2}}{P+0.8}$
