3. Consider a horizontally uniform atmosphere in hydrostatic balance. The atmosphere is isothermal, with temperature of $-10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Surface pressure is $1000 h P a$.

(a) Consider the level that divides the atmosphere into two equal parts by mass (i.e., one-half of the atmospheric mass is above this level). What is the altitude, pressure, density and potential temperature at this level?
(b) Repeat the calculation of part (a) for the level below which lies $90 \%$ of the atmospheric mass.

ANSWER:
(a) For an isothermal atmosphere in hydrostatic balance,

$$
\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}=-g \rho=-\frac{g p}{R T}
$$

whence

$$
p(z)=p(0) \exp \left(-\frac{z}{H}\right)
$$

where $H=R T / g$. With $R=287 \mathrm{Jkg}^{-1} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}, T=-10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=$ $263 \mathrm{~K}, H=7.69 \mathrm{~km}$. Mass above level $z$ is $M(z)$ where

$$
M(z)=\int_{z}^{\infty} \rho d z=-g \int_{z}^{\infty} \frac{\partial p}{\partial z} d z=g p(z)
$$

The level at which $M(z)=M(0) / 2$ has

$$
p(z)=p(0) / 2=500 \mathrm{hPa}=5 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~Pa}
$$

At this level, the altitude is

$$
z=-H \ln \left(\frac{p(z)}{p(0)}\right)=H \ln 2=7.69 \ln 2=5.33 \mathrm{~km}
$$

Temperature is 263 K , so density is

$$
\rho=p / R T=5 \times 10^{4} /(287 \times 263)=0.662 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}
$$

(b) The level which has $90 \%$ of the mass below it has $10 \%$ above, so $M(z)=0.1 M(0)$, whence

$$
p(z)=0.1 p(0)=100 \mathrm{hPa}=1 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~Pa}
$$

The altitude is

$$
z=-H \ln \left(\frac{p(z)}{p(0)}\right)=7.69 \ln 10=17.71 \mathrm{~km}
$$

Here, density is

$$
\rho=p(z) / R T=10^{4} /(287 \times 263)=0.132 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}
$$
