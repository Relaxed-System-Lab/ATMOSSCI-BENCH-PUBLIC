3. What is the value of the centrifugal acceleration of a particle fixed to the earth at the equator and how does it compare to $g$ ? What is the deviation of a plumb line from the true direction to the centre of the earth at $45^{\circ} N$ ?

The centrifugal acceleration at the equator is just $\Omega^{2} a$, where $\Omega=$ $2 \pi / 86400=7.27 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ is the Earth's rotation rate and $a$ is the Earth radius, which we here take to be 6370 km . Then the centrifugal acceleration at the equator is just $A_{e q}=\Omega^{2} a=0.034 \mathrm{~ms}^{-2}$, a factor $3.5 \times 10^{-3}$ smaller than gravity. At $45^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$, the centrifugal acceleration is $A_{45}=\Omega^{2} r_{45}$, where $r_{45}=a \cos \left(45^{0}\right)$ is the distance
from the surface to the rotation axis. Then $A_{45}=0.024 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}$, directed outward, normal to the rotation axis, as illustrated in the figure. This acceleration has a vertical component (normal to the surface) of $A_{45} \cos \left(45^{\circ}\right)=0.017 \mathrm{~ms}^{-2}$ and a horizontal component (directed equatorward) of $A_{45} \sin \left(45^{\circ}\right)=0.017 \mathrm{~ms}^{-2}$. Hence the net (gravity + centrifugal) acceleration is directed at an angle $\gamma$ to the downward vertical, where

$$
\tan \gamma=\frac{A_{45} \sin \left(45^{\circ}\right)}{g-A_{45} \cos \left(45^{\circ}\right)}=0.0017
$$

Since this number is small, we may use the small angle approximation, so that $\gamma=0.0017 \mathrm{rad}=0.097^{\circ}$.
