2. Consider the tropical Hadley circulation in northern winter, as shown schematically in Fig.1. The circulation rises at $10^{\circ} \mathrm{S}$, moves northward across the equator in the upper troposphere, and sinks at $20^{\circ} \mathrm{N} . \mathrm{As}$ suming that the circulation, outside the near-surface boundary layer, is zonally symmetric (independent of $x$ ) and inviscid (and thus conserves absolute angular momentum about the Earth's rotation axis), and that it leaves the boundary layer at $10^{\circ} S$ with zonal velocity $u=0$, calculate the zonal wind in the upper troposphere at (a) the equator, (b) at $10^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$, and (c) at $20^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$.


ANSWER:
The angular momentum density (in our usual notation) is

$$
M=\Omega a^{2} \cos ^{2} \varphi+u a \cos \varphi
$$

Figure 1:

In the upper tropospheric branch of the circulation, angular momentum is conserved, so $M=M_{0}$ is constant. Note that $\Omega a^{2}=\left(\frac{2 \times \pi}{86400}\right) \times$ $\left(6.371 \times 10^{6}\right)^{2}=2.952 \times 10^{9} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. Since at $10^{\circ} \mathrm{S}, u=0$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
M_{0} & =\Omega a^{2} \cos ^{2}\left(10^{\circ}\right)=\Omega a^{2} \cos ^{2}\left(\frac{\pi}{18}\right) \\
& =2.952 \times 10^{9} \times \cos ^{2}\left(\frac{\pi}{18}\right)=2.863 \times 10^{9} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, at other latitudes,

$$
u=\frac{M_{0}-\Omega a^{2} \cos ^{2} \varphi}{a \cos \varphi} .
$$

(a) At $\varphi=0^{\circ}$,

$$
u=\frac{M_{0}-\Omega a^{2}}{a}=-\frac{8.9 \times 10^{7}}{6.371 \times 10^{6}}=-13.9 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}
$$

Note that this is easterly-air moves further away from the rotation axis as it goes from $10^{\circ} \mathrm{S}$ to the equator.
(b) At $\varphi=+10^{\circ}$,

$$
u=\frac{M_{0}-\Omega a^{2} \cos ^{2}\left(\frac{\pi}{18}\right)}{a \cos \left(\frac{\pi}{18}\right)}=0
$$

since the air has now moved, after crossing the equator, back to the same distance from the rotation axis as when it started.
(c) At $\varphi=+20^{\circ}$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
u & =\frac{2.863 \times 10^{9}-2.952 \times 10^{9} \times \cos ^{2}\left(\frac{\pi}{9}\right)}{6.371 \times 10^{6} \times \cos \left(\frac{\pi}{9}\right)} \\
& =42.8 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

This is westerly - the air has moved closer to the rotation axis and has therefore"spun up".
The profile of $u(\varphi)$ in the upper troposphere is in fact as shown in Fig.
