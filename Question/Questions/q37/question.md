2. Assume that, in the mixed layer, mixing maintains a vertically uniform temperature. A heat flux of $25 \mathrm{Wm}^{-2}$ is applied at the ocean surface. Taking a reasonable representative value for the mixed layer depth, determine how long it takes for the mixed layer to warm up by $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. [Use density of water $=1000 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$; specific heat of water $=4187 \mathrm{~J}$ $\mathrm{kg}^{-1} K^{-1}$.]


ANSWER:
Adopt a representative value of $D=100 \mathrm{~m}$ for the mixed layer depth. Then the heat capacity of the mixed layer per unit area is (where $c$ is specific heat and $\rho$ density)

$$
\begin{aligned}
H & =c \rho D \\
& =4.19 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{JK}^{-1} \mathrm{~m}^{-2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore the warming rate, when heated by a heat flux of $25 \mathrm{Wm}^{-2}$, is

$$
\frac{d T}{d t}=\frac{25}{4.19 \times 10^{8}} \simeq 6.0 \times 10^{-8} \mathrm{Ks}^{-1}
$$

so the time taken to warm up by 1 K is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\tau & =1.7 \times 10^{7} \mathrm{~s} \\
& \simeq 0.5 \mathrm{yr} .
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence, e.g., one expects to see a significant time lag of ocean temperatures with respect to solar forcing (i.e., warmest water well after summer solstice) and, in places where the mixed layer is deep, relatively little seasonal variability of mixed layer temperatures. Where the mixed layer is shallower than 100 m , the time scale is comparable with or less than a season, so there will be a larger annual variation of upper ocean temperature.
