1.5. If a baseball player throws a ball a horizontal distance of 100 m at $30^{\circ}$ latitude in 4 s , by how much is it deflected laterally as a result of the rotation of Earth?
Solution: Assume that the ball is thrown eastward and that $u=x / t$ is constant, where $x=100 \mathrm{~m}$ and $t=4 \mathrm{~s}$. From (1.21) $v=D y / D t=-(2 \Omega \sin \phi) u t$, but $\sin \phi=0.5$. Thus, in this case, $v=-\Omega u t$, integrating in time yields

$$
y=-\Omega u t^{2} / 2=-\Omega x t / 2=-\left(7.292 \times 10^{-5}\right)(100 \times 4) / 2 \mathrm{~m}, \text { or } y=-1.46 \mathrm{~cm}
$$

Thus, the ball is deflected to the right.
