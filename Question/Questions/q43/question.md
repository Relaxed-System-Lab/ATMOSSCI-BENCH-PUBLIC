1.15. For the conditions of Problem 1.14, compute the variation of the temperature with respect to height. (This is referred to as an autoconvective lapse rate.)

Solution: From Problem $1.14 p=p_{0}-\rho_{0} g z$, where $p_{0}$ is the surface pressure. But

$$
T=\frac{p}{\rho R}=\frac{\left(p_{0}-\rho g z\right)}{\rho_{0} R}=\frac{p_{0}}{\rho_{0} R}-\frac{g}{R} z=T_{0}-\frac{g}{R} z \quad \text { Thus, } \Gamma=g / R \approx 34 \mathrm{Kkm}^{-1}
$$
