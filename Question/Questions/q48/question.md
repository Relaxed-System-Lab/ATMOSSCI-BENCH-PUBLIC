2.8. Suppose an air parcel starts from rest at the 800 hPa level and rises vertically to 500 hPa while maintaining a constant $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ temperature excess over the environment. Assuming that the mean temperature of the $800-500 \mathrm{hPa}$ layer is 260 K , compute the energy released owing to the work of the buoyancy force. Assuming that all the released energy is realized as kinetic energy of the parcel, what will the vertical velocity of the parcel be at 500 hPa ?

Solution: Substituting from the ideal gas law $\rho=p / R T$ into (2.51), we get $\frac{D w}{D t}=g\left(\frac{T_{0}^{-1}-T^{-1}}{T^{-1}}\right)=g\left(\frac{T-T_{0}}{T_{0}}\right)$, which gives the force per unit mass. But the energy released is given by force $\times$ distance traveled. From the hypsometric equation (1.30),
$\delta Z=\left(R T_{0} / g\right) \ln \left(p_{1} / p_{2}\right)$. Thus, energy released per unit mass $=g \delta Z\left[\left(T-T_{0}\right) / T_{0}\right]=R\left(T-T_{0}\right) \ln \left(p_{1} / p_{2}\right)=135 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~kg}^{-1}$. If all goes into kinetic energy, then $w^{2} / 2=135 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}$, so that $w=16.43 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ at 500 hPa .
