2.11. French scientists have developed a high-altitude balloon that remains approximately at constant potential temperature as it circles Earth. Suppose such a balloon is in the lower equatorial stratosphere where the temperature is isothermal at 200 K . If the balloon were displaced vertically from its equilibrium level by a small distance $\delta z$, it would tend to oscillate about the equilibrium level. What is the period of this oscillation?

Solution: From Eq. (2.52), the parcel oscillation frequency is $N=\left[g \frac{d \ln \theta_{0}}{d z}\right]^{1 / 2}$. But for isothermal conditions from (2.47), we obtain $d \ln \theta_{0} / d z=g /\left(c_{p} T\right)=(9.8) /[(1003)(200)]=4.885 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}$. Thus, the period of the oscillation is $2 \pi / N=2 \pi /\left[(9.8)\left(4.885 \times 10^{-5}\right)\right]^{1 / 2}=287 \mathrm{~s}$, or about 4.8 minutes.
