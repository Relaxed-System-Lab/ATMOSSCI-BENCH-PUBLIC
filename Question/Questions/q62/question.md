4.12. A westerly zonal flow at $45^{\circ}$ is forced to rise adiabatically over a north-south-oriented mountain barrier. Before striking the mountain, the westerly wind increases linearly toward the south at a rate of $10 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ per 1000 km . The crest of the mountain range is at $800-\mathrm{hPa}$, and the tropopause, located at 300 hPa , remains undisturbed. What is the initial relative vorticity of the air? What is its relative vorticity when it reaches the crest if it is deflected $5^{\circ}$ latitude toward the south during the forced ascent? If the current assumes a uniform speed of $20 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ during its ascent to the crest, what is the radius of curvature of the streamlines at the crest?

Solution: By potential vorticity conservation $\left(\frac{f_{0}+\zeta_{0}}{\delta p_{0}}\right)=\left(\frac{f_{1}+\zeta_{1}}{\delta p_{1}}\right)$. But, $\zeta_{0}=-\partial u / \partial y=10^{-5} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}, f_{0}=2 \Omega \sin (\pi / 4)=$ $1.03 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}, \delta p_{0}=700 \mathrm{hPa}, f_{1}=2 \Omega \sin (2 \pi / 9)=9.37 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}, \delta p_{1}=500 \mathrm{hPa}$. Thus, $\zeta_{1}=-1.29 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. For a uniform flow the vorticity is entirely due to curvature so that $\zeta_{1}=V / R$. Thus, $R=V / \zeta_{1}=-1.55 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m}$ (-1550 km).
