4.14. (a) How far must a zonal ring of air initially at rest with respect to Earth's surface at $60^{\circ}$ latitude and 100-km height be displaced latitudinally in order to acquire an easterly (east to west) component of $10 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ with respect to Earth's surface? (b) To what height must it be displaced vertically in order to acquire the same velocity? Assume a frictionless atmosphere.

Solution: An approximate solution can be obtained by considering conservation of angular momentum for small changes $\delta R$ in the distance to the axis of rotation of Earth: $\Omega R^{2}=\left[\Omega+\frac{\delta u}{(R+\delta R)}\right](R+\delta R)^{2}$, where $\delta u=10 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$, the change in zonal wind under angular momentum conservation. Expanding gives $\delta u \approx-2 \Omega \delta R$. Now, for latitudinal displacement
$\delta R=-\delta y \sin \phi$, while for vertical displacement $\delta R=\delta z \cos \phi$. Thus, for $60^{\circ}$ latitude we find $\delta y=-79 \mathrm{~km}$, or $0.71^{\circ}$ equatorward, and $\delta z=138 \mathrm{~km}$.
