Given that the acceleration due to gravity decays with height from the centre of the earth following an inverse square law, what is the percentage change in $g$ from the earth's surface to an altitude of 100 km ?

ANSWER:
Writing $g=\frac{\text { const }}{r^{2}}, \delta g=-2 \frac{g \delta r}{r}$ and so:

$$
\frac{\delta g}{g}=-2 \frac{\delta r}{r}
$$

Percentage change in $g$ from the earth's surface to an altitude of 100 km is then $\sim 2 \times \frac{10^{5}}{6 \times 10^{6}} \sim 3 \%$.
