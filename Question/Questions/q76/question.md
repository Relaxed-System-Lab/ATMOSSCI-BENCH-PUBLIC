Somewhere (in a galaxy far, far away) there is a planet whose atmosphere is just like that of the Earth in all respects but one - it contains no moisture. The planet's troposphere is maintained by convection to be neutrally stable to vertical displacements. Its stratosphere is in radiative equilibrium, at a uniform temperature $-80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, and temperature is continuous across the tropopause. If the surface pressure is $1000 h P a$, and equatorial surface temperature is $32^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, what is the pressure at the equatorial tropopause?

ANSWER:
If the troposphere is neutrally stable to dry convection, then potential temperature $\theta$ is uniform with height within the troposphere. Since $\theta=T=305 \mathrm{~K}$ at the surface $\left(p=p_{0}\right), \theta$ has this value at all heights. At the tropopause, the temperature is equal to the stratospheric value, $-80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=193 \mathrm{~K}$, and its potential temperature must also be $\theta=305 \mathrm{~K}$. Since $\theta=T\left(p / p_{0}\right)^{-\kappa}$, where $\kappa=2 / 7$ for the atmosphere, the pressure at the tropopause must therefore be

$$
p=p_{0}\left(\frac{T}{\theta}\right)^{\frac{1}{\kappa}}=1000 \times\left(\frac{193}{305}\right)^{\frac{7}{2}}=201.6 \mathrm{hPa} .
