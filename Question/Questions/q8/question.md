1.4. A train is running smoothly along a curved track at the rate of $50 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. A passenger standing on a set of scales observes that his weight is $10 \%$ greater than when the train is at rest. The track is banked so that the force acting on the passenger is normal to the floor of the train. What is the radius of curvature of the track?
Solution: The weight measured by the scales $(1.1 \mathrm{mg})$ is the vector sum of the forces of gravity $(\mathrm{mg})$ and the centrifugal force owing to the curvature of the tracks $\left(m u^{2} / r\right.$, where $m$ is the mass of the train, $u$ is the speed and $r$ the radius of curvature Thus,

$$
(1.1 m g)^{2}=(m g)^{2}+\left(m u^{2} / r\right)^{2}
$$

Thus, $r=u^{2} /(g \sqrt{0.21})=556 \mathrm{~m}$.
