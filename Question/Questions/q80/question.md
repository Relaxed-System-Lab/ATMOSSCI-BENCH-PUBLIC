Spectroscopic measurements show that a mass of water vapor of more than $3 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-2}$ in a column of atmosphere is opaque to the 'terrestrial' waveband. Given that water vapor typically has a density of $10^{-2} \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$ at sea level and decays in the vertical like $e^{-\left(\frac{z}{b}\right)}$, where $z$ is the height above the surface and $b \sim 3 \mathrm{~km}$, estimate at what height the atmosphere becomes transparent to terrestrial radiation.

ANSWER:
Writing the density of water vapor $\rho_{v}=\rho_{v_{\text {surface }}} e^{-\left(\frac{z}{b}\right)}$ then the atmosphere becomes transparent to terrestrial radiation at a height $z^{*}$, say, such that

$$
\int_{z^{*}}^{\infty} \rho_{v} d z=\int_{z^{*}}^{\infty} \rho_{v_{\text {surface }}} e^{-\left(\frac{z}{b}\right)} d z=b \rho_{v_{\text {surface }}} e^{-\frac{z^{*}}{b}}=3 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-2}
$$

This gives $z^{*}=7 \mathrm{~km}$ if $b=3 \mathrm{~km}$.
The temperature at this height is $\sim 250 \mathrm{~K}$, roughly the same as the emission temperature of the planet. This provides excellent independent support to the idea that convective systems transport heat and moisture up to a height (and hence temperature) at which water vapor is the principle re-radiator of terrestrial wavelengths.
