(a) Assuming a balance between incoming and outgoing radiation, calculate the emission temperature for Jupiter. 

(b) In fact, Jupiter has an internal heat source resulting from continued planetary contraction. Using the conventional definition of emission temperature T_e, σ T_e^4 = (outgoing flux of planetary radiation per unit surface area) the measured emission temperature of Jupiter is 130 K. Calculate the magnitude of Jupiter's internal heat source.

(c) It is believed that the source of Q on Jupiter is the release of gravitational potential energy by a slow contraction of the planet. On the simplest assumption that Jupiter is of uniform density and remains so as it contracts, calculate the annual change in its radius a_Jupiter required to produce your value of Q. (Only one half of the released gravitational energy is convertible to heat, the remainder appearing as the additional kinetic energy required to preserve the angular momentum of the planet.)

Determine the radii of curvature for the trajectories of air parcels located 500.0 km to the east, north, south, and west of the center of a circular low-pressure system, respectively. 
The system is moving eastward at 15.0 m/s. Assume geostrophic flow with a uniform tangential wind speed of 15.0 m/s. 
Then determine the normal gradient wind speeds for the four air parcels using the radii of curvature computed. Compare these speeds with the geostrophic speed.

Determine the radii of curvature for the trajectories of air parcels located 502.937568752 km to the east, north, south, and west of the center of a circular low-pressure system, respectively. 
The system is moving eastward at 16.3385351332 m/s. Assume geostrophic flow with a uniform tangential wind speed of 21.100202964 m/s. 
Then determine the normal gradient wind speeds for the four air parcels using the radii of curvature computed. Compare these speeds with the geostrophic speed. 
(Let f=0.0001 s^-1). Use the gradient wind speeds calculated here to recompute the radii of curvature for the four air parcels. 
Use these new estimates of the radii of curvature to recompute the gradient wind speeds for the four air parcels. 
What fractional error is made in the radii of curvature by using the geostrophic wind approximation in this case?  (Note that further iterations could be carried out, but would rapidly converge.)
