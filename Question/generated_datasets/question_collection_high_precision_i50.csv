Consider the thermal balance of Haumea. You will need the following information about Haumea: mean planetary radius = 816 km; mean radius of orbit around the Sun = 43.22 A.U. (where 1 A.U. is the mean radius of the Earth's orbit); planetary albedo = 0.51.

(a) Assuming a balance between incoming and outgoing radiation, calculate the emission temperature for Haumea. 

(b) In fact, Haumea has an internal heat source resulting from continued planetary contraction. Using the conventional definition of emission temperature T_e, σ T_e^4 = (outgoing flux of planetary radiation per unit surface area) the measured emission temperature of Haumea is 50 K. Calculate the magnitude of Haumea's internal heat source.

(c) It is believed that the source of Q on Haumea is the release of gravitational potential energy by a slow contraction of the planet. On the simplest assumption that Haumea is of uniform density and remains so as it contracts, calculate the annual change in its radius a_Haumea required to produce your value of Q. (Only one half of the released gravitational energy is convertible to heat, the remainder appearing as the additional kinetic energy required to preserve the angular momentum of the planet.)

(b) Given that the heat content of an elementary mass dm of dry air at temperature T is $c_{p} * T * dm (where $c_{p} is the specific heat of air at constant pressure), find a relationship for, and evaluate, the (vertically integrated) heat capacity (heat content per degree Kelvin) of the atmosphere per unit horizontal area. Find how deep an ocean would have to be in order to have the same heat capacity per unit horizontal area.

Determine the radii of curvature for the trajectories of air parcels located 381.791380143 km to the east, north, south, and west of the center of a circular low-pressure system, respectively. 
The system is moving eastward at 7.6329876168 m/s. Assume geostrophic flow with a uniform tangential wind speed of 18.5735241418 m/s. 
Then determine the normal gradient wind speeds for the four air parcels using the radii of curvature computed. Compare these speeds with the geostrophic speed. 
(Let f=0.0001 s^-1). Use the gradient wind speeds calculated here to recompute the radii of curvature for the four air parcels. 
Use these new estimates of the radii of curvature to recompute the gradient wind speeds for the four air parcels. 
What fractional error is made in the radii of curvature by using the geostrophic wind approximation in this case?  (Note that further iterations could be carried out, but would rapidly converge.)
