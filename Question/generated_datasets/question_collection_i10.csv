Using the conventional definition of emission temperature T_e, σ T_e^4 = (outgoing flux of planetary radiation per unit surface area) the measured emission temperature of Saturn is 95 K. Calculate the magnitude of Saturn's internal heat source.

(c) It is believed that the source of Q on Saturn is the release of gravitational potential energy by a slow contraction of the planet. On the simplest assumption that Saturn is of uniform density and remains so as it contracts, calculate the annual change in its radius a_Saturn required to produce your value of Q. (Only one half of the released gravitational energy is convertible to heat, the remainder appearing as the additional kinetic energy required to preserve the angular momentum of the planet.)

(b) Given that the heat content of an elementary mass dm of dry air at temperature T is $c_{p} * T * dm (where $c_{p} is the specific heat of air at constant pressure), find a relationship for, and evaluate, the (vertically integrated) heat capacity (heat content per degree Kelvin) of the atmosphere per unit horizontal area. Find how deep an ocean would have to be in order to have the same heat capacity per unit horizontal area.

Suppose an air parcel starts from rest at the 867 hPa level and rises vertically to 591 hPa while maintaining a constant 0.5°C temperature excess over the environment. Assuming that the mean temperature of the 867-591 hPa layer is 297 K, compute the energy released owing to the work of the buoyancy force. Assuming that all the released energy is realized as kinetic energy of the parcel, what will the vertical velocity of the parcel be at 591 hPa?

Determine the radii of curvature for the trajectories of air parcels located 590.0 km to the east, north, south, and west of the center of a circular low-pressure system, respectively. 
The system is moving eastward at 8.0 m/s. Assume geostrophic flow with a uniform tangential wind speed of 21.0 m/s. 
Then determine the normal gradient wind speeds for the four air parcels using the radii of curvature computed. Compare these speeds with the geostrophic speed. 
(Let f=0.0001 s^-1). Use the gradient wind speeds calculated here to recompute the radii of curvature for the four air parcels. 
Use these new estimates of the radii of curvature to recompute the gradient wind speeds for the four air parcels.

Determine the radii of curvature for the trajectories of air parcels located 330.0 km to the east, north, south, and west of the center of a circular low-pressure system, respectively.

The planet Mars rotates about its axis so slowly that to a reasonable approximation the Coriolis parameter may be set equal to zero. 
For steady, frictionless motion parallel to latitude circles, the momentum equation (2.20) then reduces to a type of cyclostrophic balance:
