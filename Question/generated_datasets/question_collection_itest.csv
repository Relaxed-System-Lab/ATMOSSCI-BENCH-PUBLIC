A watershed is 80% good condition open space/lawn, 40% of which is soil group C and 60% is soil group A. The remaining 20% of the watershed is fairly covered forest land with soil group C. The curve numbers for different soil conditions are tabulated below. Use the SCS Method to estimate the excessive precipitation for a total of 7.0 inches of rainfall in this watershed. State clearly all your assumptions. With normal antecedent runoff conditions (ARC II) and Ia=0.2S.
