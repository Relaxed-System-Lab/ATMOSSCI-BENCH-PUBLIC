Consider an ocean of uniform density 500.0 kg/m^3. The ocean surface, which is flat in the longitudinal direction, slopes linearly with latitude from h=0.7 m above mean sea level (MSL) at 40° N to h=0.5 m below MSL at 47.90640148938674° N. Using hydrostatic balance, find the pressure at depth 60.0 m below MSL. Hence show that the latitudinal pressure gradient ∂p/∂y and the geostrophic flow are independent of depth. Determine the magnitude and direction of the geostrophic flow at 43.95320074469337° N.

Suppose an air parcel starts from rest at the 900.0 hPa level and rises vertically to 500 hPa while maintaining a constant 1°C temperature excess over the environment. Assuming that the mean temperature of the 900.0-500 hPa layer is 300 K, compute the energy released owing to the work of the buoyancy force. Assuming that all the released energy is realized as kinetic energy of the parcel, what will the vertical velocity of the parcel be at 500 hPa?

Then determine the normal gradient wind speeds for the four air parcels using the radii of curvature computed. Compare these speeds with the geostrophic speed.

Determine the radii of curvature for the trajectories of air parcels located 700.0 km to the east, north, south, and west of the center of a circular low-pressure system, respectively. 
The system is moving eastward at 10 m/s. Assume geostrophic flow with a uniform tangential wind speed of 30 m/s. 
Then determine the normal gradient wind speeds for the four air parcels using the radii of curvature computed. Compare these speeds with the geostrophic speed. 
(Let f=0.0001 s^-1). Use the gradient wind speeds calculated here to recompute the radii of curvature for the four air parcels. 
Use these new estimates of the radii of curvature to recompute the gradient wind speeds for the four air parcels. 
What fractional error is made in the radii of curvature by using the geostrophic wind approximation in this case?  (Note that further iterations could be carried out, but would rapidly converge.)

Determine the radii of curvature for the trajectories of air parcels located 300.0 km to the east, north, south, and west of the center of a circular low-pressure system, respectively. 
The system is moving eastward at 10 m/s. Assume geostrophic flow with a uniform tangential wind speed of 20 m/s. 
Then determine the normal gradient wind speeds for the four air parcels using the radii of curvature computed. Compare these speeds with the geostrophic speed.

The planet Mars rotates about its axis so slowly that to a reasonable approximation the Coriolis parameter may be set equal to zero. 
For steady, frictionless motion parallel to latitude circles, the momentum equation (2.20) then reduces to a type of cyclostrophic balance:

By transforming this expression to isobaric coordinates, show that the thermal wind equation in this case can be expressed in the form:
ω_r^2(p1) - ω_r^2(p0) = -(R * ln(p0 / p1)) / (a * sin(φ) * cos(φ)) * (∂⟨T⟩ / ∂y),

Given that water vapor typically has a density of 0.01 kg/m^3 at sea level and decays in the vertical like e^(-z/3.0), where z is the height above the surface and b ∼ 3.0 km, estimate at what height the atmosphere becomes transparent to terrestrial radiation.
