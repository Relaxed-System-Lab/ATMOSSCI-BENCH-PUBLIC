Consider an ocean of uniform density 500.0 kg/m^3. The ocean surface, which is flat in the longitudinal direction, slopes linearly with latitude from h=0.5 m above mean sea level (MSL) at 20° N to h=0.3 m below MSL at 27.297658641015865° N. Using hydrostatic balance, find the pressure at depth 50.0 m below MSL. Hence show that the latitudinal pressure gradient ∂p/∂y and the geostrophic flow are independent of depth. Determine the magnitude and direction of the geostrophic flow at 23.648829320507932° N.

Determine the radii of curvature for the trajectories of air parcels located 300.0 km to the east, north, south, and west of the center of a circular low-pressure system, respectively. 
The system is moving eastward at 30 m/s. Assume geostrophic flow with a uniform tangential wind speed of 30 m/s. 
Then determine the normal gradient wind speeds for the four air parcels using the radii of curvature computed. Compare these speeds with the geostrophic speed. 
(Let f=0.0001 s^-1). Use the gradient wind speeds calculated here to recompute the radii of curvature for the four air parcels. 
Use these new estimates of the radii of curvature to recompute the gradient wind speeds for the four air parcels. 
What fractional error is made in the radii of curvature by using the geostrophic wind approximation in this case?  (Note that further iterations could be carried out, but would rapidly converge.)

Determine the radii of curvature for the trajectories of air parcels located 600.0 km to the east, north, south, and west of the center of a circular low-pressure system, respectively. 
The system is moving eastward at 10 m/s. Assume geostrophic flow with a uniform tangential wind speed of 10 m/s. 
Then determine the normal gradient wind speeds for the four air parcels using the radii of curvature computed. Compare these speeds with the geostrophic speed.

Determine the radii of curvature for the trajectories of air parcels located 700.0 km to the east, north, south, and west of the center of a circular low-pressure system, respectively. 
The system is moving eastward at 20 m/s. Assume geostrophic flow with a uniform tangential wind speed of 10 m/s. 
Then determine the normal gradient wind speeds for the four air parcels using the radii of curvature computed. Compare these speeds with the geostrophic speed. 
(Let f=0.0001 s^-1). Use the gradient wind speeds calculated here to recompute the radii of curvature for the four air parcels. 
Use these new estimates of the radii of curvature to recompute the gradient wind speeds for the four air parcels. 
What fractional error is made in the radii of curvature by using the geostrophic wind approximation in this case?  (Note that further iterations could be carried out, but would rapidly converge.)

Determine the radii of curvature for the trajectories of air parcels located 300.0 km to the east, north, south, and west of the center of a circular low-pressure system, respectively. 
The system is moving eastward at 20 m/s. Assume geostrophic flow with a uniform tangential wind speed of 10 m/s. 
Then determine the normal gradient wind speeds for the four air parcels using the radii of curvature computed. Compare these speeds with the geostrophic speed. 
(Let f=0.0001 s^-1). Use the gradient wind speeds calculated here to recompute the radii of curvature for the four air parcels. 
Use these new estimates of the radii of curvature to recompute the gradient wind speeds for the four air parcels. 
What fractional error is made in the radii of curvature by using the geostrophic wind approximation in this case?  (Note that further iterations could be carried out, but would rapidly converge.)

Determine the radii of curvature for the trajectories of air parcels located 1000.0 km to the east, north, south, and west of the center of a circular low-pressure system, respectively. 
The system is moving eastward at 20 m/s. Assume geostrophic flow with a uniform tangential wind speed of 30 m/s. 
Then determine the normal gradient wind speeds for the four air parcels using the radii of curvature computed. Compare these speeds with the geostrophic speed.

Then determine the normal gradient wind speeds for the four air parcels using the radii of curvature computed. Compare these speeds with the geostrophic speed. 
(Let f=0.0001 s^-1). Use the gradient wind speeds calculated here to recompute the radii of curvature for the four air parcels. 
Use these new estimates of the radii of curvature to recompute the gradient wind speeds for the four air parcels. 
What fractional error is made in the radii of curvature by using the geostrophic wind approximation in this case?  (Note that further iterations could be carried out, but would rapidly converge.)

Determine the radii of curvature for the trajectories of air parcels located 800.0 km to the east, north, south, and west of the center of a circular low-pressure system, respectively. 
The system is moving eastward at 10 m/s. Assume geostrophic flow with a uniform tangential wind speed of 10 m/s. 
Then determine the normal gradient wind speeds for the four air parcels using the radii of curvature computed. Compare these speeds with the geostrophic speed.

Determine the radii of curvature for the trajectories of air parcels located 500.0 km to the east, north, south, and west of the center of a circular low-pressure system, respectively. 
The system is moving eastward at 20 m/s. Assume geostrophic flow with a uniform tangential wind speed of 10 m/s. 
Then determine the normal gradient wind speeds for the four air parcels using the radii of curvature computed. Compare these speeds with the geostrophic speed. 
(Let f=0.0001 s^-1). Use the gradient wind speeds calculated here to recompute the radii of curvature for the four air parcels. 
Use these new estimates of the radii of curvature to recompute the gradient wind speeds for the four air parcels. 
What fractional error is made in the radii of curvature by using the geostrophic wind approximation in this case?  (Note that further iterations could be carried out, but would rapidly converge.)

Determine the radii of curvature for the trajectories of air parcels located 400.0 km to the east, north, south, and west of the center of a circular low-pressure system, respectively. 
The system is moving eastward at 10 m/s. Assume geostrophic flow with a uniform tangential wind speed of 20 m/s. 
Then determine the normal gradient wind speeds for the four air parcels using the radii of curvature computed. Compare these speeds with the geostrophic speed. 
(Let f=0.0001 s^-1). Use the gradient wind speeds calculated here to recompute the radii of curvature for the four air parcels. 
Use these new estimates of the radii of curvature to recompute the gradient wind speeds for the four air parcels.
